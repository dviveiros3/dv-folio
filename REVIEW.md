# Site Review & Strategic Advice

## Goal Assessment
**User Goals:**
1. Expand brand and consulting firm.
2. Make money (Revenue generation).
3. Use personal businesses as a portfolio of initial customers.

**Does the current site work for these goals?**
*   **Expand Brand/Firm:** **No.** The site is currently branded as a high-end personal resume ("Daniel Viveiros"). It positions you as an *employee* or *freelancer*, not a scalable *firm*.
*   **Make Money:** **Partially.** It might generate job offers or contracting leads, but it lacks clear "Products" or "Services" that a client can buy.
*   **Portfolio:** **Hidden.** Your personal businesses ("One Home Installations", "Disciplined Minds Tutoring") are buried in a timeline, making them look like past *jobs* rather than *client success stories*.

## Strategic Changes Needed

To pivot from "Daniel Viveiros, The Person" to "Impact Tech Studio, The Firm", you need to make the following changes:

### 1. Rebranding (The "Firm" First)
*   **Current:** Hero section says "Daniel Viveiros".
*   **Change:** Change the main H1 to **"Impact Tech Studio"**.
*   **Change:** Update copy from "I believe..." to "We believe..." or "Our Philosophy...".
*   **Why:** Clients pay more for a firm's system/process than for an individual's time. This also allows you to scale by hiring others later.

### 2. Elevate "Portfolio Companies" to "Case Studies"
*   **Current:** Listed as lines in the "Executive Journey" timeline.
*   **Change:** Create a dedicated **"Our Work"** or **"Ventures"** section.
*   **Action:** Create a card for "One Home Installations" and "Disciplined Minds Tutoring" similar to the "Snowflake Cost-Governance" one.
    *   **Challenge:** What problem did the business have?
    *   **Solution:** What tech/strategy did the Studio provide?
    *   **Result:** Revenue growth, efficiency, etc.
*   **Why:** This proves you can build and scale businesses, not just work in them.

### 3. Productize Your Services
*   **Current:** "Expertise" lists skills like "AI Strategy". This is a resume feature.
*   **Change:** Create a **"Services"** section with clear offers.
    *   *Example 1:* **"Fractional CTO/CDO"** (Retainer based)
    *   *Example 2:* **"Snowflake Cost Audit"** (Fixed price, high value)
    *   *Example 3:* **"AI Readiness Roadmap"** (Workshop + Report)
*   **Why:** "Book 15-min intro" is vague. Clients need to know *what* they are buying.

### 4. Technical Improvements (Code Review)
*   **Fixed:** I have already fixed a bug in the "Quantified Impact" section where numbers would reset to "0" or "$0.0M" if the user scrolled away. They now stay visible.
*   **Recommendation:** The "Timeline" section is great for an "About Founder" page, but for the home page, it distracts from the "Studio" narrative. Consider moving it to a separate page or moving it to the bottom.

## Summary Checklist
1. [ ] **Rename Hero:** "Daniel Viveiros" -> "Impact Tech Studio"
2. [ ] **Add Services Section:** List 3 core offerings.
3. [ ] **Refactor Timeline:** Move "Portfolio Companies" out of the timeline and into a "Featured Projects" section.
4. [ ] **Update CTA:** Change "Book 15-min intro" to "Get a Free Audit" or "View Services".
