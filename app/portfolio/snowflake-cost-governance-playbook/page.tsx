  Effectively managing Snowflake costs is crucial for maximizing its value and ensuring a sustainable cloud data strategy. This playbook provides a comprehensive framework for establishing robust cost governance in your Snowflake environment. By implementing these strategies, organizations can gain better visibility into their Snowflake expenditure, optimize resource utilization, prevent unexpected cost overruns, and align cloud spending with business objectives. A well-defined cost governance strategy not only helps in reducing operational expenses but also fosters a culture of cost-consciousness across teams, leading to more efficient and predictable cloud investments.
